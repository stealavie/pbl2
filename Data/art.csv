ILLUMINATED TAPESTRIES ,"Three new gorgeous art blankets from our weaver-bees! Mad geniuses Michael DeForge; Lorenzo Mattotti and Ben Passmore join the growing list of artists designing stunningly detailed soft-touch tapestry-woven natural-fiber cotton blankets. 
These beauties are limited edition (500 of each); and made in the USA by a family of textile artisans. Smash that pledge button! Or keep reading. And then smash it.


As small press publishers of fine editions; our team at the Hive has a reputation for obsessing over the tactile. The fine-grained tooth of an uncoated cotton-rag paper stock; the loose organic weave of a raw buckram; the sculptural divot of a filigreed blind emboss. Our books are renowned for their material; experiential qualities. They'll activate all five senses; if you're bold enough to lick them.
Last year; we swapped out the presses for looms and text for textiles to make woven blankets the likes of which the world has never seen.
Our launch series from last year; also available through this campaign!
ILLUMINATED TAPESTRIES is a line of glorious fine art blankets. New work by world-renowned artists; woven into soft-touch natural fiber cotton textiles; crafted on Jacquard looms by our team of expert weavers in Blacksburg; South Carolina. Each design is limited to an edition of 500 pieces; never to be reproduced again.
And now we're back; with a brand new series; and more astonishing artists waiting in the wings.

The blankets are woven entirely out of natural cotton yarn on a Dornier Rapier Jacquard loom by a family-run maker that has been operating in the textile industry out of Blacksburg; South Carolina for over forty years. The fiber content is 100% cotton (the black yarn is a recycled cotton with 10% poly blend); and the throws are premium quality; including 15% more filling than a standard weave; giving the blankets a luxe and weighty yet still soft finish.

His book Sports Is Hell; a story about football riots; political tensions; and kneeling; won the 2021 Eisner award for Best Single Issue.

Risks and challenges
As book publishers; textile manufacturing is a somewhat new world for us. But this is now our second blanket project; and the first was fulfilled swiftly with work of outstanding quality. We've done copious research and testing for this project; and figured out every detail of the production process. In fact; this imprint was custom-designed to circumvent some of the overseas supply-chain issues that have brought untold challenges to our publishing practice in the last few years. Our blankets are manufactured by a family business in South Carolina that's been doing this kind of work for four decades. The raw materials we're using are abundant and easy to acquire. Our business model is simple and sensible; and doesn't require huge outlays of capital. Figuring out new production challenges is one of the things we do best; and we've brought our many years of publishing expertise to bear on creating our plan here. There are always new risks and challenges; but we feel more than ready to tackle them. We fully expect to deliver these gorgeous blankets in a swift and timely fashion; just as we did last time.

JAMAIKA,"Thank you for taking interest in my photography book: JAMAIKA
With your support it will be possible to publish this book. 
JAMAIKA is a photography documentary book that tells the story of an often racialised and marginalised community of around 700 people - Bairro da Jamaica; located in Seixal; Portugal – and their fight for dignified housing.
Short Film produced in 2020 
I started a collaboration with people from the community in 2020; which resulted in a documentary short film; focusing on the racial; and subsequently housing; inequality this community has had to live through for several years; as well as their pressing need to relocate to better housing. That film premiered at the DocLisboa Festival; in Portugal; in 2021.
Intimate photography work
I have; since then; continued to closely and intimately document the life of the community; which is made primarily of migrants from African countries which used to be Portuguese colonies - Angola; Guinea-Bissau and São Tomé and Principe - as well as second and third generation Portuguese citizens; whose ancestors came from those same countries. 

Housing inequality 
The community have lived in unfinished buildings; in extreme deprivation; since the late 70s; lacking basic living conditions.

Bairro da Jamaica has ended
While Bairro da Jamaica was demolished in 2023; its buildings destroyed and the families moved to better housing; ‘Jamaika’ as a community has prevailed. The sense of sharing; love and care will endure beyond its former physical location (Vale de Chícharos) and will continue to be a part of the lives of those who lived there.

Book JAMAIKA as a memory of the community
JAMAIKA not only follows the struggle and the battles this neighbourhood had to overcome; but it also celebrates the love and happiness that flourished within this community with a history that goes back 40 years. It tells their story and documents their move to better housing. 

This book tries to be a visual memory of Jamaica neighbourhood; while also representing many other racialised communities living in similar housing conditions around Lisbon; Portugal. These are communities and lives that are mostly forgotten by the Portuguese governments and by the local authorities and regularly segregated and stigmatised by society. In this case; the families from Bairro da Jamaica had often been marginalised by the local authorities; such as the local city council and the local police force.
Through my photography and my storytelling approach; I hope you will see a book that values and dignifies the lives of these families; individually; and of Bairro da Jamaica as whole.
Collaboration with local rapper Kid Robinn
Along with other texts; the book includes the lyrics to the song Perspectiva; written by Kid Robinn; a local rapper from the community.

I'd love your support to help me make this book a reality
After making a short documentary film with the community - supported by an emergency grant from the National Geographic Society - I have spent the past two and a half years self-funding this documentary story. Now; once the photography work is finished; I believe that to publish these community story in a book format is the right next step!  
By supporting this crowdfunding campaign; you are not only helping with the printing and publishing of the book; but you are getting limited editions that won´t be available elsewhere. 
This is a self-published book edition and your support goes 100% to fund the production of the book. Which includes: printing; binding costs; design; texts; translation and editing costs. 
JAMAIKA book will be launched in January 2024 in a solo exhibition at NARRATIVA in Lisbon; Portugal.

KYANOS,"The story of KYANOS
I unknowingly started working on KYANOS in September 2019 when I visited Greece for the first time while exploring the islands of Sifnos and Milos. As most people do; I fell instantly in love and have visited 10 islands over the past 5 years with many more still on the list. 
On each trip I realised how diverse the landscapes were; from the ""Listerine"" blue waters of Paxos and pine forest cliffs of Kefalonia to the volcanic; windy and harsh landscape of Milos. 
The word kyanos; meaning ""dark blue enamel"" is where the word ""cyan"" is derived. While many will associate this word to describe the colour blue; as seen in the later periods of the Greek language; it has also been used to describe darker tones. Greek Philosophers use the term ""kyanos"" intermittently to mean both ""dark blue"" and also ""black"". In a book on precious stones; Aristotle’s pupil Theophrastus describes the (blue) lapis lazuli as kyanos-colored. Homer’s Iliad; on the other hand; describes not only the color of steel but also the hair Hector as kyanos. 
""Hector was dragged; his kyanos hair was falling about him"".
It was a deliberate choice to give the book this name; but not have a blue cover. I wanted to explore the double meaning of the word; give space to both the stereotype of Greece but also pay homage to the warmer tones you'll see in the book. When I think of Greece I don't just think of blue and white; I think of rich reds; burnt orange and vivid greens. This work explores the rough and rugged side of some of Greece's most popular destinations but also some beautiful hidden gems on lesser known islands. 
KYANOS features the following islands; 
Milos; Sifnos; Kefalonia; Mykonos; Syros; Paros; Paxos; Ithaca; Santorini and Corfu.

About me
My name is Joe Howard; a photographer based in London. I've been shooting since 2010 and over the past 5 years I have focused on creating work while exploring new places and visiting my childhood home in Cornwall. 
My work pays particular attention to light and colour in the form of observational landscapes and street photography; I believe if the light is just right; the benign can be beautiful. 



The Book
All the images in this book were shot on film. Using both 35mm and 120; scanned by Chan Photographic; edited and graded by Joe Howard and converted by Tom Groves.
Offset printed by KOPA in Lithuania
Hardback cover: 225mm x 275mm
 Debossed black foil cover design.
 
142 pages
 
90 photos
 




More than blue...
KYANOS is a photobook for people that have already fallen in love with Greece; those that want to see a different side to Greece and those that wish to visit. I want to show people the contrasted shades of these beautiful islands and in turn explore both the positives and challenges of tourism. These islands have so much more to offer than picture perfect instragram posts; dig deeper and you will find thriving communities; rich ecology and a diverse and ever evolving landscape. 


Design
This book has been designed by Jon Vallance. The design references both the colours and textures found within the book; while also taking wider inspiration from Greek art.
The cover pays homage to the repeating patterns often seen in ceramics and pottery mastered by the Athenians. This Geometric Style was characterized by motifs such as black lines; zig-zags; triangles and concentric circles. In designing KYANOS; Jon has used these guiding principles to create an interesting and unique motif.

Proposed Timeline
November 2023: Final sequencing & book design
December 2023: Wet-proof and final edits 
January/February 2024: Send to print
March/April 2024: Dispatch books and rewards

Why Kickstarter?
The kickstarter campaign is to raise funds to help with the cost of printing; designing and distribution of KYANOS. 
Without your support this project would not be possible. Your support is vital to make this KYANOS happen; and is very much appreciated.


Risks and challenges
The biggest challenge with this project will be printing and the potential delays that come with that. I've given plenty of time; so I don't image then there will be any issues.

This will be a project to help me afford the cost of printing my first edition of fine art fine art prints.  I am hoping to get my work in to some art galleries in addition to selling prints on my website.  In order to get gallery representation I fist need to have a body of excellent quality prints available.  Backers of this project have access to these prints at prices which are lower then what will be offered on my website.
OASIS

Why are fine art prints so expensive? 
It is mainly the specialized paper and archival inks they use. The images are expertly calibrated to make sure they come out exactly how they should in print.

What will I do with extra funds?
If I get funded over my targeted goal -I will need the extra funds in order to market my work with on line adds in order to make sure my prints get found by potential buyers.

Risks and challenges

For people who are planning on sending the prints a Christmas gift you may want to have the reward go directly to the recipient. here is what Kickstarter recommends: I will send a survey to request the recognized name and/or address at the end of the project. You could back a project through your account; and then provide the recipient’s name and/or address in the survey. Alternatively; you could create a Kickstarter account in the name of the recipient; make the pledge; and give them the account (making sure they don't save any of their personal payment information). The recipient could then change the password and email address if desired.

SEA STATE,"For the last year I have been crafting this book as a new way to share my work and obsession with the ocean and coastal environment; the book communicates a vision that a single print or even several prints could never convey. It brings disparate geographies; weather; and sensations together so viewers can feel each moment and connect it with a larger perspective of the natural world.
I’m asking for your help on the final step of the project; the printing of a unique and beautiful monograph. By backing this Kickstarter campaign; you’ll help make the publishing possible and will receive a hand-signed copy.
Sea State will be a hardcover book produced with high-quality materials selected for their longevity and ability to reproduce photographs accurately. It will be printed and bound by a leader in fine art printing to ensure an outstanding first edition. The book will be 11” tall and 13” wide; a large size to convey the detail in these images and immerse viewers in the visual.
""Now; wandering along the sublime shore; this moment stopped me...""
""A place time has abandoned; where the ocean breaks on the coast and the churn penetrates each crevice...""
What's inside
Sea State is a photographic journey of interactions; experiences; and observations of the ocean; captured over a period of 16 years starting in 2007. It reflects my own evolution in perspective as I became more drawn to the images of the sea; finding in it a mental escape and a source of inspiration. 
The book contains 80 pages with photographs from places ranging from my home of Marblehead; Massachusetts; to Cape Cod; Maine; Florida; Bermuda; France and more.

One of the full-size dummy pages for testing the color; layout; and sizing of the book
Printing & delivery
Once the Kickstarter campaign has concluded; the book cover; binding; and pre-press details will be finalized; and proofs will be created.  As I work with the printing company to ensure the color and other details are spot on; I will update backers on the progress. Overall; I expect it will take 3-5 months before the books are delivered. 
Cover concept
About the artist
I have been making art for the last 25 years; including works in wood; ceramic; metal and graphic design; digital experiences; and most importantly photography. I studied art at Wheaton College in Norton; Massachusetts and have continuously pursued the creation of captivating and thought-provoking images of natural subjects - the mountains; forest; coast and water. Ever admiring the latter; I was drawn to make my life near the ocean and settled in Marblehead on the north shore of Massachusetts; a place with a rocky coast and strong passion for sailing; my other fascination.

 
Risks and challenges
There are no foreseeable risks; I have completed the photographs; and the book is ready for press.",D:/PBL22/hehe/hehe/Image/arts/SEA STATE/725bdd3fb449dfe76946b000fb267658_original.jpg

Views from Japan
When I first came to Japan in 2019 I always struggled to find credible tips and recommendations on where to visit to avoid over-crowded areas. Determined; I spent countless hours studying Japanese magazines; reading guidebooks; contacting tourism boards and asking my local friends where to visit. Fast forward four years and I have travelled extensively across 30 prefectures; tried and tested experiences from all corners of the country and delved deeper into Japan than I ever thought possible. 
In Views from Japan; I share everything I know so that you can explore Japan in more meaningful ways; and have a truly authentic experience for your next trip. Included are highlights from over 20 prefectures; from the northern mountains of Hokkaido to the tropical islands of Okinawa; the hidden temples of Kyoto to the unique architecture of Tokyo; and many more!

The Power of Print
In an increasingly digital world; I am passionate about creating something physical that you can enjoy and gain maximum value from. Japan has such a special place in my heart and having learnt so much about traditional crafts and culture; I think the only way to truly do that justice is to bring you something beautifully designed that you can refer back to whenever you wish. Having worked as a graphic designer for six years before moving to Japan; I have gained a wealth of experience and knowledge in producing printed publications and can’t wait to share this book with you. 
 
Over 20 prefectures are explored in detail

A More Meaningful Way to Experience Japan
With the borders now open and tourism in full swing; the demand for travel in Japan is higher than ever. Many famous areas are becoming very crowded and suffering from over-tourism. I want to offer you a more meaningful experience; one that encourages you to travel to lesser-known destinations; and explore Japan’s unique cultural experiences. I have personally visited every location in this book and each recommendation is based on my own experience. 
 
Discover unique architecture; traditional Japanese culture and bucket list experiences

How is ‘Views from Japan’ Different to Other Travel Guides?
Ever since the pandemic; many travel guides have quickly become out of date; with venues closing their doors and new locations frequently popping up. In Views from Japan; I aim to bring you timeless destinations and experiences; whether that is a unique architectural destination; a lesser-known neighbourhood or a beautifully designed countryside hotel. The venues; locations and adventures within Views from Japan are all written from the perspective of a local.

Who is the Guide for?
Whether you are visiting Japan for the first time; have been multiple times; live in Japan or have just returned from a trip; I want you to be able to gain value from this guide. That being said; Views from Japan is not an extensive compendium of places to visit; but a carefully curated selection based on my taste; experience and interests in culture; architecture and lesser-known destinations.
Who is it Not for?
Through this book; I hope to inspire the culturally curious; design-conscious and open-minded travellers amongst us. Views from Japan will give you all of the tools you need to be able to create a unique and memorable trip to Japan; whether you are travelling for a solo trip; honeymoon or family adventure. If you are looking for a guidebook that features Tokyo’s cutest cafes; latest restaurant openings or most famous Instagram hotspots; then this guide might not be the best tool for you.
