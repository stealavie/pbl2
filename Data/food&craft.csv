Lady Wong Patisserie,"Photo Credit: Dan Ahn
We're Seleste and Mogan; and Lady Wong is our brainchild. We met while creating and experimenting with stunning food at work. With our combined experiences in international kitchens; from Shangri-La to the Four Seasons and at Michelin-starred restaurants such as Jean-Georges; Perry St.; and WD-50; we felt a calling to share our passion for traditional pastries; even 10;000 miles away from our home country of Malaysia.

It all started in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic when we were unable to travel back to Malaysia. We yearned for a taste of home while very far away. This desire led to the creation of Lady Wong in our home kitchen where we focused on traditional Southeast Asian flavors and ingredients executed with French technique learned in our years of experience. Our range consists of baked goods from cakes and tarts to puddings and crêpes. We originally began selling out of the back of our car; then pop ups and eventually we took on the challenge of opening our very own brick and mortar in NYC.
Lady Wong Whole Cake Collection
The cakes; pastries and traditional sweet treats reflect the authentic heritage and culture of what we desire to share - stunning; eye catching slices of Southeast Asia with modern twist of French techniques; both figuratively and literally . The fragrance of sweet Pandan leaves (Indonesian Vanilla) and the coconut palm sugar syrup play important roles on Lady Wong's menu. More than just a delight to the tastebuds; they bring with them the stories of Southeast Asia.
Some of our most popular cakes at Lady Wong (In Order Clockwise: Pandan Matcha Tart; Coconut Sugar Cake; Fresh Fruit Shortcake; and Vietnamese Coffee Entremet. 

Just as much as culture and heritage extends for centuries; our desire to share the beautiful stories of Southeast Asia goes beyond tradition. So; as we continue to introduce new colors to our already vibrant Lady Wong offerings; we are thrilled to share that the Lady Wong Tempeh Chips now takes a permanent spot on the menu. What began as a spontaneous treat and token of gratitude for our patient Lady Wong customers during the bustling days at our humble first store; the Tempeh Chips are now a crunch sensation; all packed and ready to go. Rich in protein; vegan; and gluten free; this superfood from Indonesia is full of the kind of goodness that is suitable for everyone; eight or eighty. Now you can indulge in guiltless pleasure with Lady Wong's Tempeh Chips in one of the four flavors; or better yet; all of them.
Through Kickstarter we're exclusively launching brand new packaging and flavors of our Lady Wong Protein Tempeh Chips at a HUGE DISCOUNT!",D:/PBL22/hehe/hehe/Image/food & crafts/Lady Wong Patisserie - Shipped to your Doorstep/cae8b454cf391b9e96d5c5bb32756b77_original.jpg
Make pickles in Picklestone with natural seasonings!,"“Picklestone” is a glass pot that makes it easy to create Japanese traditional pickles called “Tsukemono”.





We are launching a new challenge for the first time in a year!

Picklestone evolves every year. First we developed Picklestone itself; followed by the development of soy sauce specifically for pickles; and then the development of T-Unit; a tea and dashi strainer for enjoying ""Ochazuke""（0-chazuke;  rice in tea or dashi）with pickles. In this way; we continue to create various ideas with the goal of making vegetables more delicious. Our belief is to be eco-friendly and eat up all the vegetables we can.
On the other hand; there was a problem！ We have heard from some dear Picklestone users: ""I don't know how much salt to put in the vegetables."" ""I don't know what to add and in what quantities to make it taste better."" We realized that Picklestone's problem was the difficulty of balancing flavors; which depended on cooking skills.


This time; we worked to solve this problem. As a result; we developed  natural seasonings that make pickles easier to make!

There are 5 different flavors in this bag; 100 bags in total.

Until now; we have published many recipes and videos; but that is no longer necessary. With only the natural seasoning we have developed this time; it is now possible for ANYONE to easily make pickles with a consistent taste in an instant.



As a pickles startup from Japan; we aim to create a world where safe and delicious vegetables are not left behind or thrown away; but instead are made into tasty pickles; ""Tsukemono"" and eaten up!
NOTE: The seasoning package is under development.
 
How to make ""Tsukemono"" with ""Picklestone""？
It really is that easy. Just place diced vegetables into the Picklestone glass pot; sprinkle on the newly developed seasoning; put the included stone on top and wait. With only these three steps; you can easily take in fermented foods into your diet and eliminate ",D:/PBL22/hehe/hehe/Image/food & crafts/Make pickles in Picklestone with natural seasonings!/6a26bd9df988020636847e27e80f50e3_original.jpg
Nambu Tekki Iron Pot ,"As the Nambu Tekki Ironware transmits heat uniformly throughout the pot; when the rice cooks; the natural sweetness and flavour is brought out; and allows it to cook to perfection! You can enjoy traditional authentic rice at home! 

Rice that has been made in a Nambu Tekki Iron Pot is beloved by many thanks to the unique properties that the rice that is made contains. Nambu Tekki is a traditional crafting method of making cast iron products that hails from the southern region of Iwate Prefecture. Rice that is steamed in these types of pots are known for having a distinctive taste that comes from being made in this type of pot.
By using Nambu Tekki Ironware; you will be able to see the amazing qualities of the pan that makes food made in the pots extremely delicious for yourself:
1. Uniform heating: Cast ironware is efficient in its conducting of heat; and uniformly heats the food inside. When making rice; this allows for the rice to become fluffy and with a brilliant texture.
2. A flavourful aroma: As the iron pot uses a wooden lid made from natural cedar; when the rice is steamed; this wood gives off a unique aroma. This aroma helps to whet the appetite and makes your mouth food in anticipation for the meal to come. 
3. Beautifully cooked rice: Rice that has been cooked in the pot has a wonderful shine to it; even when only a small amount of rice has been cooked. This makes rice that has been cooked in the pot look even more appealing!
４.Heat Rentetive:
Cast iron products not only are great at conducting heat but also retaining it! Rice that has been cooked in a Nambu Tekki Pot stays warm until you have served it up. This makes it possible to enjoy tasty rice for longer!
5. A traditional production method and value: Nambu Tekki is a traditional crafting method that is quintessentially Japanese. This traditional crafting method is based on a rich history and culture; which is conveyed into the production of the items. Through this; by making rice using the Nambu Tekki ironware pot; you can also have the chance to experience a part of Japanese food culture and tradition. 
Rice that has been made in this way is said to have a unique taste and special traditional value to it; which is a reason many people love rice made in this way. We hope that you can experience this for yourself.",D:/PBL22/hehe/hehe/Image/food & crafts/Nambu Tekki Iron Pot - Make delicious fluffy rice with ease!/72e6d3c2cfa0bd90ac4c3adb9c510041_original.png

The benefits of ultrasonic cutting

How does the ultrasonic technology work? 
It all starts with an ultrasonic generator. It receives energy from the battery and converts it into a high-voltage and high-frequency signal. This means; for example; that 12 V makes 900 V and at a certain frequency it passes this voltage on. In order for it to be an ultrasonic generator; the signal must run at a frequency of 20;000 Hz or more.
This signal goes on to the ultrasonic transducer; which is one of the most important parts of ultrasonic cutting. The ultrasonic transducer acts as a kind of converter. Its purpose is to receive a high-frequency electrical signal and convert it into a high-frequency mechanical motion.
And at the end of this process is a booster that acts as an acoustic resonance enhancer. This is traditionally attached to the tip or the blade. In our case; however; we wanted to preserve the design of a traditional knife; so we went without a booster and fixed the blade directly to the transducer.
