DrawnTogetherGame ,"Think about what the key features are. Use the same colour as your opponent to obliterate their silhouette; try to add contrasting colours to reinforce your own silhouette; and prioritise the key features of the shapes. 
This is a competitive; strategic; vicious; brutal colouring-in game for two adults (or strategically-minded children).
The game finishes when the sheet is completely coloured in. At this point; you show it to a third party to determine the winner. Simply ask; ""What does this look like? Love heart or skull?"" (Or whatever the two objectives were.) 
If you're playing in public; ask a stranger. Maybe you'll make a new friend! They have to decide one of the two and their first answer is all that matters.
If you're at home; you can ask a family member or housemate. Whoever the judge is; it's just important that they don't know who was aiming for each objective. That removes any potential bias.
If you're on social media; use the #DrawnTogetherGame hashtag and ask people what it looks like. Make a poll and you'll usually find that there's a strong consensus. 
And I promise to reply to every message I see that asks me to judge any game; if you'd like me to arbitrate.*
After many games played; and several Twitter polls; there is usually one option that gets 70% of the votes. You create a unique momento. And when you replay; thanks to different decisions made; the results can be very different.
Full rules here. 
Love heart or Skull?

The Queen's New Capital,"Theodore G. Williford awoke one morning; not feeling much like himself.  His head throbbed with every beat of his heart and he could feel his brow; cold and wet. The bed groaned under his weight as he swung his legs out of bed. Maybe he had gained some weight after all. It was light out; he could make out that much from the window. He reached for his spectacles but clumsily pushed behind the nightstand. He was so tired and so very thirsty. 


He stumbled towards the bathroom; barreling through the room without much balance; loud footsteps clamoring on the hard wood floor. He grasped the sink to avoid crashing into the checkered tile floor; only then his vision finally adjusting. In the mirror; what he saw; seemed unreal.  He'd been working too hard. Skipping meals to classify more species. Sketching anatomical drawings when he should have been sleeping.

Clearly this must be why his once human features; handsome and refined; had transformed. His skin looked dark and shiny; eyes like a well of the blackest ink.  His thick hair was gone; a serrated horn instead protruding from his forehead. He stood frozen; mesmerized by a grotesque visage he immediately recognized; Coleoptera Scarabaeidae Dynastinae ...The Rhinoceros Beetle.",D:/PBL22/hehe/hehe/Image/games/The Queen's New Capital/4f4025caf233a133212f039058287130_original.jpg
What We Possess,"You have been here for some time. This school; this cemetery; this fairground; this theatre. You've been trapped; unable to leave; no matter how you've tried. For beyond the walls here there is a hum; a whispering madness that you are not yet ready to join.

You know that with the help of the living; you can find your answers. Whether they're willing; or whether you must enter their bodies and make them help you. And find these answers you must; before your energy finally runs out and leaves you to the whispers. Gather your energy; gather your vessels; for this...
...this is What We Possess.
