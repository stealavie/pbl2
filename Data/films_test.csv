Flying the Fortress - Saving World War II History,"My friend George once said: ""I know what a deadline is. A deadline is when you have a 97 year old veteran waiting on you; and he is saying he doesn't have much time. Everything else can go to the side."" For the past year; myself and two of my closest friends - Josh and George; have been travelling across the country to locate and interview the last surviving veterans from World War II who participated in the air war. We have been blessed to already locate and record with 18 of them; and we even made documentaries on two of them. Many of these veterans withheld many of their stories after the war ended - not wanting to speak of their experience. So much of their stories were undocumented - until now. Because were able to locate and interview a handful of them; we were able to capture history. History - that would have otherwise - been lost.  
However; we are now faced with a problem: We have had more veterans reach out; wanting to share their stories with us. But because of how time sensitive this endeavor is; we cannot fund these trips alone in the amount of time necessary. So; we are looking to raise funds to help contribute to airfare; hotels; and rental cars as we travel to meet and interview these heroes. I will continue to fund a large portion of this project myself; but in order to reach all of the veterans currently on our list; we will need to meet this goal. 
As a part of this campaign; we have put together some fantastic rewards for supporters! They range from posters for the movie; to personalized videos from veterans; to even coming WITH US to research or record the interviews! But more than anything; the greatest reward will be knowing that you helped keep the legacy alive of the heroes of World War II.
With the footage that we get from these interviews; we will be making a great number of personal recreations and mini-documentaries for individual veterans that will be posted on the TJ3 History YouTube and Facebook pages; as well as distributed in any other ways we can find. But in addition to the mini-documentaries; we will also be making full length feature films that will combine interviews from multiple veterans. The first that we are announcing; which will be the primary film of this campaign; will be ""Flying the Fortress"" - a documentary following the stories of multiple B-17 crewmembers. 
As of right now; we have already recorded four interviews with B-17 veterans that will be featured in this feature film. We currently have four others waiting right now. At the end of our travels in the first quarter of 2024; we plan to take all of the footage from the B-17 veterans and begin work on editing; writing; and post production. Then; we hope to have the project finished and ready by Veterans Day 2024. 
There is only one chance to complete this project; as in just a few years; nearly all of these veterans from the second World War will be gone. We hope that you will help us capture their stories and preserve this crucial history.

Rinda (The Queue),"Introduction
Hi; We are a crew of University students raising money for our final-year film - Rinda (The Queue).
A story about perseverance; patience and ambitions of people who are part of a herd - waiting to reach a mysterious destination; and this project is planned to be a grotesque; surreal and stylized illustration of it.

K is a 9 year-old boy. He and his mother have joined a mystically never-ending queue leading to an unknown destination. People move; new people join and everyone with their own personal reasons is stubbornly holding to their place. Eventually; everyone loses track of time and the queue goes on from one generation to the next. People still move; people still join. K; now an adult man is forced to leave his older mother behind in order to keep his place in the queue; reaching the end of it only as an old man himself and finally realising the mother's life-long pursuit; she had decided to take her son along to.

Christspiracy - The Spirituality Secret Film,"What if...
90 BILLION LIVES were taken every single year; and religious leaders were turning a blind eye to it?
*Hint: it’s not a ""what if"" - it’s a reality exposed in this film.
Christspiracy (the next chapter to Seaspiracy; What The Health; Cowspiracy) is an investigative documentary following daring filmmakers Kip Andersen and Kameron Waters as they expose how religious leaders are turning a blind eye to animal exploitation—despite compassion being the one core principle in all world religions. 
It's the biggest cover-up in 2;000-years; and it will change the way you think about faith; ethics and our relationship with animals; forever. 

It all began with one transcendental question…

This question was posed during a divine chance encounter Kip Andersen had with Kameron Waters at a Cowspiracy Q&A...
Kam told Kip he was an inspiring filmmaker; and Kip said this could be the missing piece to his previous films.
This was the beginning of a 5-year journey to unearthing the truth about why the world’s major religions hid a devastating secret from their followers. 
A secret that we unearth in Christspiracy... 

After producing and co-creating blockbuster Netflix documentaries; Cowspiracy; What the Health; and Seaspiracy; Kip was missing one essential element from his film lineage: ethics and spirituality. 

This simple; yet transcendent question caused Kip and Kam to take a step back from all that that they knew to be true. The rest is history; Christspiracy was born...
Kam had to step away from the church and his career as a gospel songwriter and musician for Sony Records and start living out of his van named Mira...

Kip knew he had to jump back into his trusty van Super Blue...

...to complete the series of groundbreaking films on the impacts of the animal agriculture industry.

The Quest Begins
For 5 years; we traveled continent to continent hopping from Rome to Jerusalem; Oxford to India—interviewing everyone from renowned theologians and archeologists to Christian farmers and Indigenous shamans—all to reveal the biggest cover-up in the last 2;000 years; one that will transform history; forever.

Turns out; faith has everything to do with...
...our relationship to animals—especially eating them. Whether you’re eating chicken fried steak at a Christian barbecue or purchasing Halal meat from a Muslim butcher. All of the global faiths have a stance on eating animals.
This film covers the ethical angle of our relationship with animals and the industries that exploit them; specifically through the lens of world religions. 
But also spirituality; philosophy; sociology; psychology; and the history of how we ended up where we are today.

What you know about Hinduism; Christianity; Islam; Judaism and Buddhism’s stance on its relationship with meat and animals may not be true… 
...but the truth will be revealed only if you back this film.
Even major religious leaders don't know this truth… 
...but they will now.
*Car chase and undercover footage included.  ????????????

Everything we discovered in this film will shock you to your core...

After countless hours of research; years of relentless investigation; and tireless hours of planning; filming; and editing; we returned home and presented our first cut to Netflix.

Let’s just say; we felt Netflix didn’t know how to...
...view what we uncovered. They wanted to redact key parts and take the film in a different direction; while we dove deeper in the direction that we knew the investigation needed to go. So…
...we stayed true.
To ensure you were shown the 2;000-year cover-up we knew you needed to see; we boldly...
GOT OUR FILM RIGHTS BACK
Here's where you come in...
With your support; we can bust open the limited access of streaming platforms; and reach a significantly greater; more diverse audience with this unifying message of peace; justice; and compassion.
Though we are grateful that our previous films were among the top performers on the platform; this time; we wanted to go where no other film has gone before and share the greatest story never fully told—our way.
Together; we’re unleashing Christspiracy into the world.

Support The Film and Pay-it-Forward
Christspiracy’s “Pay-it-Forward” model is simple: You spread the word of compassion by generously “gifting” or ""paying it forward"" to someone else; allowing them to watch the film for FREE. It’s a cycle of kindness that YOU get to start.
With your help; we’ll:
•	Let people pay what they want 
•	Let people pay for others
•	Spread the message of the film to BILLIONS of people
This philosophy allows the film to be accessible to anyone around the world; regardless of one's income status or subscription. 
We have an opportunity to show Christspiracy:
•	In theaters 
•	On our own collective streaming platform
•	Any and everywhere (We’re talking Youtube; Amazon; your place of worship...and the list goes on!)
Paying-it-forward will also drive virality through an exponential effect of incentivized sharing.

Much like this Kickstarter campaign; the more you pay-it-forward; the more exclusive perks you unlock; and the more impact you will create. How divine is that?


We are igniting the truth and compassion revolution by releasing Christspiracy to the world—independently and uncensored with a goal of reaching 1 BILLION views to save BILLIONS of lives.

Premise:
What kind of treatment will a person endure when put under financial and social pressure?
Overview:
19 year old Alex Turnsdale has taken a dead-end job at a local Pharmacy to pay the bills until he can find full-time work. He’s living on a friend’s couch in Southern California after moving from Sioux City; Iowa. His mom is his only family member he’s close with; but she’s broke and working in a Dollar General back home; barely making it by. 
We meet Alex on his second day of work; after a not-so-hot day one. His boss; Mr. Nelson has told him that if he doesn’t make all his deliveries today; he should just not come back tomorrow. High standards from a guy paying $9/hr. But it’s the only option Alex has.
Alex embarks on his first delivery of the day; where he will encounter Scooter Simmons; a failed business-man and entrepreneur; who lives in his childhood home. Scooter and the home have both fallen into a quirky kind of disrepair.
This is where our story begins.

Risks and challenges
There will always be logistical; technical; and creative challenges with any film project. That being said; we feel confident in our ability to deliver. While this may be our first narrative project together; it is certainly not our first production. Between the two of us we have hundreds of successful shoots under our belts; which have honed our ability to lead a film set & execute creative visions to their fullest potential. We're also fortunate enough to know many talented artists & technicians who have already expressed their willingness to join the crew. The financial cost of this project is truly the biggest obstacle; so with the help of your contributions through this Kickstarter campaign we should be set up for success!",D:/PBL22/hehe/hehe/Image/film/Rx - Short Film/cac5885165f8dcc6b257f3e6cfe6a3e9_original.jpg
The Nightlight's Next Act,"TWO SCREENS. TWICE THE IMPACT.
Bringing the Second Screen dream to life will not only broaden film selections and showtimes for our audiences. It'll also bolster our ability to build a connected community centered on cinema — right here in Downtown Akron.
The possibility is within reach. And you play an important part when you pledge toward our Second Screen Kickstarter!

Who are we?
Since opening in 2014; The Nightlight has been Akron's go-to spot for independent and arthouse films any night of the week; where everyone is welcome to enjoy the magic of cinema. Over the years; we've hosted over 100;000 filmgoers; showcased over 1;000 unique film selections; and built a tight-knit community of diverse film fans from across Northeast Ohio in the process — all with only one screen.
In 2023 alone; we have shown over 100 films and have increased attendance by 65% — while staying true to the independent spirit and love of cinema with which The Nightlight was founded.
Next year; 2024; will be our 10th year here in downtown Akron. To celebrate; we're looking to take our mission of making arthouse cinema more accessible for everyone to the next level. How? By building a second screen and expanding our space — a project that promises to bring even more diverse films and community events to our city.

Your donation gets us one step closer to our goal.
Reaching our goal for this Kickstarter will allow us to get closer to construction for The Nightlight Second Screen. It will also give us momentum to continue pursuing our overall Second Screen campaign goal; which; once reached; will allow us to finalize the expansion; from upgrading the marquee and facade to building the second screen; as well as installing the new bar; ticket booth; and library… and other exciting surprises!

Why a Second Screen?
The Nightlight began as the dream of Akron Film + Pixel; a nonprofit film festival that grew out of The University of Akron; starting way back in 2007. The group's passion and hard work for years led to the cinema being built downtown in 2014. Now; a decade later; that dream; passion; and hard work is still burning brighter every year; thanks to our growing and giving community!
It's been part of the vision from day one to have more than one screen so we can reach more people more effectively with broader film selections and showtimes; and a better overall cinematic experience for our city. With the continual support from our passionate community; that possibility is right around the corner!
This Second Screen expansion will bring:
•	More film options for our audience — a more comprehensive and wide range of choices — plus more showtimes; and an improved cinema experience for everyone.
•	Classy gathering space with greater availability for hosting community events.
•	Strengthened partnerships with local nonprofits and organizations.
•	The opportunity to hold virtual conversations with filmmakers from around the world.
•	Over 30;000 extra visitors each year to Akron's Historic Arts District and the Downtown Akron Ecosystem.

What's our plan; and what's our schedule?
We’re looking to double our space’s size and screen count... and more than double our impact.
Big projects have a lot of moving parts; which makes for a timeline that can shift depending on this or that factor. Large-scale construction projects take a lot of commitment; time; and flexibility — and we're committed to completing the second screen expansion.
We will be one step closer to starting construction once we reach our Kickstarter goal of $50;000. And when we reach our overall Second Screen goal; we hope to kick off construction in our 10th year. That said; hitting (and exceeding!) our Kickstarter goal will get the process started.
By giving to our campaign; you're playing an essential part in bringing the long-term dream of The Nightlight community to life! ??

What's our project budget?
Our primary goal is to raise $50;000 to kick-start this leg of the big project — but exceeding this amount will enable us to enhance the upgraded cinema’s features and offerings; ensuring a world-class film experience for our current and future patrons.
We have completed Phase One; which involved Design Architects; Structural Engineers; Mechanical; Plumbing; and Electrical Engineers; Architects of Records; and Construction Bids. Many meetings; minds; and hours have gone into getting The Nightlight Second Screen Project this far. But we still have a long way to go. It takes a lot of work to prepare for something this excellent.
Here are just a few expenses:
•	Professional Services: $50;000
•	Theater Equipment & Install: $125;000
•	Construction: $700k+
•	Plus additional expenses
As a nonprofit organization; The Nightlight is being as fiscally sound and responsible as possible to make this project happen. We have consulted with the experts; and we want to ensure this project is completed in a timely manner; but also a smart financial manner for our organization. This Kickstarter goal is $50;000 — which is a small part of our total expense.
Why do we care?
We’re big believers in movie magic. But we're also more than a movie theater: The Nightlight is a community space that connects our audiences from Akron and Northeast Ohio with accessible; inclusive; high-quality cinematic experiences — and with each other so we can see our world in a new light together.
So in this straightforward and collective effort; each contribution; regardless of size; is a step forward in amplifying The Nightlight's impact; ensuring that cinema's magic remains accessible; diverse; and vibrant for all in Akron.
Every share; like; and mention brings us closer to realizing this dream of enriching Akron's film and cultural scene. Thank you!

TOAD'S PLACE - the documentary,"* Help us share the legend of TOAD'S PLACE with the world *
""If these walls could only talk"" - has probably been said about TOAD'S PLACE tens of thousands of times. 

Finally; after nearly 5 decades; the walls at TOAD'S PLACE will be talking ... on film ...
TOAD'S PLACE - then and now
... and - SPOILER ALERT - these walls will have a lot to say. 
An actual wall; downstairs at Toad's Place; listing some of the artists that have played at Toad's
TOAD'S PLACE is a preeminent live music venue that has helped shape and influence the American musical landscape for nearly half a century. Based in New Haven; CT on the Yale University campus; TOAD'S has hosted countless renowned artists; produced many noteworthy concerts and events; and delivered memorable entertainment experiences for generations of fans. It's also been a revered and go-to institution in its community.  
L: David Bowie; R: Bob Dylan. (Sharp-eyed fans of vintage Saturday Night Live will recognize GE Smith beside Bob.)
Some artists have played Toad's after they were already well established; like David Bowie; Bob Dylan; BB King; Bonnie Raitt; and The Rolling Stones. But some artists were barely known when they played TOAD'S and later went on to greatness - like U2 (back when Bono was Paul David Hewson); or Michael Bolton (he was Michael Bolotin; from New Haven); or The Dave Matthews Band. Each of them has credited TOAD'S for playing an important role in getting them noticed and acclaimed.

Small clubs like TOAD'S (under 1000 capacity) can play a crucial role in the development of musical performers; providing a platform for young artists to build their fan base; hone their skills; get noticed professionally; and make that important personal connection with a close-up audience. Small clubs are also important for established acts wishing to test new material and develop new styles or sounds; sometimes even the most major acts require an intimate environment like TOAD'S for a corporate gig; or in service to a cause. TOAD'S PLACE has served all these functions well. In doing so; it's been a true breeding ground for creativity and experimentation. 
L: The Pretenders - as young artists; R: James Taylor with Stephen Stills - both obviously established performers - required an intimate venue to play a show together at Toad's to support a local politician at the time
Owner Brian Phelps and late founder ""Big Mike"" Spoerndle are known for having always prioritized ""relationships."" They made a point to bond with the artists and treated them well - this is why so many artists have returned time and time again. 
L: Brian and the late great Big Mike with Johnny Cash - all wearing black; of course; R: With Melissa Etheridge 
Brian and Mike always made sure that their live audience - their public - knew they were valued guests. The TOAD'S team always strove to put forth a quality entertainment experience that was personable; professional; and affordable. Under Brian's long leadership (after the untimely passing of Big Mike); Toad's Place has also delivered for; connected with; and made a true home amid the New Haven community. 
L to R: Gregg Allman loved to hang out at Toad's. Here he is; outside in his Toad's shirt; C: Toad became a staple at New Haven community events; like here at the St. Patrick Day's parade; R: Rickie Lee Jones shooting pool at Toad's 
Welcome to the Kickstarter campaign for TOAD'S PLACE - the documentary. The film will be a tribute to the formidable and continuing legacy of TOAD'S. It will share TOAD'S and its accomplishments worldwide. It will contain never-before-seen archival footage. It will interview promoters; band members; attendees; journalists; and historians. The artists showcased transcend genre and era. And OMG; the stories ... 
""I visited Toad's Place often when I first began producing 30 for 30 films for ESPN. It's had such a special impact for me and so many others. I'm proud for the opportunity to direct this film and tell the story of TOAD'S to the world. This film will be independent; truthful; and I personally guaranty it'll be loads of fun. Please check out our Rewards. Thank you for visiting and thanks for your support!""  - Andy Billman; Director

ABOUT THE FILM
TOAD'S PLACE - the documentary; will span time; from the humble origins of the club to the present day. It'll showcase the MUSIC; the MAGIC; and the MEMORIES. It'll discuss the PEOPLE and the PARTIES. Some of the stories will be ones you might have heard; or read about; and some will truly take you behind the scenes - never shared before.
 
The film will relate the history of TOAD'S through a mix of archival footage; music; period interviews; current (updated) interviews; as well as testimony and commentary from artists; historians; attendees; and the music press. Some of the untold stories will be shared by TOAD'S crew. The film will show how TOAD'S thrived through major changes in the music industry; and how it met challenges (like the recent pandemic). 
 
This film will also shine a light on how important a small club like TOAD'S PLACE can be - to emerging and established artists; to a University community (Yale); to a City (New Haven); a State (Connecticut); and to the American musical landscape at large.

TOAD'S PLACE: CROSSING TIME AND GENRE
Under the leadership and vision of owner Brian Phelps; TOAD'S PLACE has given the New Haven area a neighborhood venue that has attracted artists globally; leading to an environment that has fostered a thriving and diverse music ecosystem.  
Here's a fun photographic journey depicting TOAD'S over time and across most genres:
At the beginning ...
L: The Talking Heads; R: New Haven native Michael Bolton
Blues legend Muddy Waters - one of the very first name acts to ever play at Toad's 
... with a little bit o' punk ... 
L: The Cramps; R: The Ramones
... through the 80's and into the 90's ...
L to R: Edie Brickell; Rick James; and Men at Work - with Brian Phelps
L to R: The Go-Go's; Cheap Trick
And from Sayreville; New Jersey - ladies and gentlemen - Bon Jovi
... even hosting The Rolling Stones ...
In 1989; the Rolling Stones prepared to go on tour for the first time in 8 years. Keith Richards lived in Fairfield County; so they chose to rehearse quietly in the beautiful northwest hills of Connecticut. After a few weeks of rehearsing; they thought it would be smart to find a small club to play first; before the tour. They reached out to legendary promoter Jim Koplik; who said: ""There's only one place; and that's TOAD'S."" It was billed as the ""Pre-Tour show"" of the ""Steel Wheels"" tour; the first time Mixed Emotions was played live. They rocked the house. 

... with rap and hip hop and metal ...
Snoop Dogg; Drake
Cardi B; Tremonti
... and most recently (just last month) ... Dogstar (with Keanu Reeves) ...
Dogstar played Toad's on October 11; 2023; that's Keanu Reeves on bass
... with occasional comedy ...
Eddie Murphy; Howie Mandel - with Brian Phelps
... and lots of great dance parties.

TOAD'S: CAMARADERIE AND COMMUNITY 
In addition to all the unforgettable live music; TOAD'S has been proud to host benefits; commercials; social gatherings; private parties; a lot of birthdays; and a most special funeral for beloved local musician and good friend Rohn Lawrence (see below). 
New Haven locals and families have gotten to know Toad - the mascot; at the St Patrick's Day parade and other city gatherings. 
The camaraderie at TOAD'S is a tribute to the comfortability of performers; staff; crew; and the general public. Everybody arrives and stays with the same goals - a good time; quality food and beverage; awesome entertainment; great visibility and ambience; an amazing sound system; and some really good people getting along famously.

*** THE BRIAN PHELPS ""THUMBS UP"" DEPT. ***  
Over the years; Brian has made it a tradition to take photographs with artists who performed at TOAD'S and give a ""thumbs up"" sign. He's got quite a collection. Brian says nobody ever said no; but he points out - alcohol was often involved as a bribe.

The Rohn Lawrence funeral and tribute - Rohn Lawrence was a New Haven jazz legend. His unique and often blazing guitar prowess; along with his larger-than-life stage presence; brought joy to local (and national) music fans for decades. Rohn suddenly passed away in December 2021 at the age of 61. Family; friends and fans alike were devastated. Rohn's sister Michele called Brian; to ask if they could hold the funeral at TOAD'S; where Rohn had played for years. Brian told her it would be his honor. Said Michele: ""I wanted to make sure I sent him off?the way he lived. I knew my brother better than anybody in the world; and I knew this is what he would want.” Rohn’s funeral (with the help of Howard K. Hill Funeral Services in New Haven) was held at Toad’s Place at 2pm on January 10; 2022. Hundreds of mourners lined up outside to pay their respects; and once inside; they lined up there too. They slowly walked across the floor below the stage; where Rohn lay in state surrounded by flowers along with two of his favorite guitars. Next came a musical tribute featuring some of the local and national artists he shared the stage and studio with over the years. “He was a great guy; talented; honest; and loved. I respected him a tremendous amount;” noted Phelps.

TOAD'S PLACE continues to be an important part of the local community; hosting numerous charity and benefit events every year since 1976. TOAD'S PLACE looks forward to many more years of serving New Haven and surrounding communities.

THE MAGIC OF TOAD'S IS IN THE STORIES
Here is a preview of a few select stories from the annals of TOAD'S PLACE that are priceless and/or played a part in music history; these and more will be ... in the film.
•	MEAT LOAF - As mentioned; some of the major acts that played TOAD'S PLACE were not well-known when they first played there. In fact; TOAD'S was the first live club gig for MEAT LOAF after the release of Bat Out of Hell. That was back in 1977. (Since then; it has sold over 43M copies; making it still one of the best-selling rock albums ever.)
op: Meat Loaf; Bottom: Billy Joel
•	BILLY JOEL -In 1980; Billy Joel was already a famous and successful artist performing in arenas. He wanted to play a small club that had great ambience and an audience that would be intensely ""into"" the performance. Noted promoter Jim Koplik immediately recommended TOAD'S PLACE. Joel was recording shows for his first-ever live album at the time; Songs in the Attic; and his version of “Los Angelenos” from TOAD'S PLACE wound up on the album! New Haven Register reporter and columnist Randall Beach wrote a wonderfully vivid piece about the evening. He spoke to Billy Joel's roots as a boxer and remarked at how seeing him in a small club; where you can see everything up close; revealed in Joel a boxer's
defiant expressions — and a penchant for sweating; too! There was a moment in the show after Joel had already completed a sing-along version of Piano Man when a fan yelled; “Play ‘Piano Man’!"" The request rang out loud and clear in a small club like Toad's. Joel paused; got up off his stool; walked to the edge of the stage and said to the guy: ""We already did that song! Where were you? Did you go out to take a piss or something?!"" Joel entertained the crowd at TOAD'S as well as anyone; ever.
John Cafferty and Bruce Springsteen; photo by Robbie DeRosa
•	JOHN CAFFERTY/BEAVER BROWN BAND & BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN - ONLY AT TOAD'S! In 1978; John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band were booked to play TOAD'S and on the same night; Bruce Springsteen was playing at the nearby New Haven Coliseum. Cafferty always modeled his singing style after Bruce. Would Bruce come see his show? He had to try! He went to the Coliseum himself during Bruce's sound check; and to his surprise; when he asked Bruce to come by TOAD'S after his gig ended; Bruce immediately said yes! It wasn't clear whether Bruce would join Cafferty on stage; John didn't push it. But then Bruce showed up at midnight and he was carrying his guitar - well ... it was quite the moment for John - and for the blown-away audience at TOAD'S.

FILMMAKER COMMENTARY
Says Andy: ""I was born in Cleveland and grew up a native Ohioan. My first taste of Connecticut came from landing a gig at ESPN in Bristol. Shortly after; I got to experience New Haven with friends; and the two things that resonated first for me; are the same two things that still resonate: awesome pizza and Toad's Place. The films I did for ESPN were wonderful experiences; but the ability to direct a film about an amazing establishment; and do it alongside that amazing establishment; and with no third-party involvement; is critical to storytelling. A filmmaker doesn't often get that opportunity. The success of this Kickstarter will help us ensure the kind of independence and editorial control needed to tell some pretty amazing stories truthfully and unimpeded. Everyone in New Haven might already know Toad's and its remarkable legacy - now it's time for everyone in America to know about it as well.""

Brian was fascinated with the martial arts and began running a Karate school midway through his college years at the University of New Haven. A strange occurrence one night at the school; led to a chance encounter with Mike Spoerndle; owner of the new Toad’s Place located just around the corner from him in Spring of 1975. One year later; 'Big Mike' invited Brian to start working at the club. Several years after that; Mike made Brian an offer to become a business partner in Toad's. In January 1995 Brian took control of the company and then bought the rest of the business from Mike in 1998. The path was fraught with challenges; but building a business and raising a wonderful family became his desired journey.  Overall; Brian feels he took “a road less traveled;” but he's glad he did; and he thinks people will enjoy learning more about his journey.

BUDGET; TIMELINE; AND USE OF PROCEEDS
Kickstarter is an ""all or nothing"" formula. A project needs to reach its target before the deadline in order for funds to transact; BUT it can keep tallying funds above the target. As such; it is typical for projects to set their target at the low end of the range. 
For TOAD'S PLACE; we are hopeful to raise well above the target. The greater the success; the more we can leverage for the balance of funding that might be needed. 

WHY KICKSTARTER
It's easy to say we came to Kickstarter to help finance the film. But there are three other reasons just as important: INDEPENDENCE; VISION; and COMMUNITY.
We love music; we enjoy nightlife; and we truly treasure the stories (and personalities). We don't want to avoid or tiptoe around anything. To do that; we must have INDEPENDENCE. We also have a clear VISION - TOAD'S PLACE is more than a venue - it's an important; impactful; and innovative part of our history. It made an impression on the American musical landscape because it is a small club. We want to mix music; stories; and reflections of its impact to make the best and most truthful film we can. Finally; COMMUNITY. That's YOU. We have already spoken with hundreds of people that attend or attended shows at TOAD'S PLACE regularly or intermittently and we hope this Kickstarter exposes us to tens of thousands more; so we can aggregate stories and opinions and integrate them into the film; the Rewards; and extra's.
We can't imagine a better place than Kickstarter; where independent films with vision are supported every day; and being part of a like-minded community is a way of life.

Risks and challenges
Making a full-length feature film; documentary or otherwise; is a challenge for anyone; even for a major studio. It is a substantial endeavor; with many moving parts. Independent film producers have to especially be able to roll with the punches.
